<b>Software</b>
RDMO is implemented as a web application. It is available as open-source software on [github.com](https://github.com/rdmorganiser). Our main use case is the collaborative collecting, editing and maintenance of all necessary information for a sustainable data management. This is done along the notion of *projects*, which will be defined by the users for their particular context.
The main functionality of RDMO includes the following features:

## Development

For the further development of RDMO, we use a roadmap process in which the existing issues on GitHub are prioritised by the community. In 2022, a large number of issues were prioritised into `critical`, `high`, `medium` and `low` in two community meetings. The best way to view the individual lists is on GitHub, under these links:

* [Critical](https://github.com/rdmorganiser/rdmo/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22priority%3A+critical%22)
* [High](https://github.com/rdmorganiser/rdmo/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22priority%3A+high%22)
* [Medium](https://github.com/rdmorganiser/rdmo/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22priority%3A+medium%22)
* [Low](https://github.com/rdmorganiser/rdmo/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22priority%3A+low%22)

To transparently communicate the status of the work in progress, we use the "Projects" functionality of GitHub, where the individual issues are displayed on a [Kanban board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board):

<https://github.com/orgs/rdmorganiser/projects/1>

New feature requests, bug reports or security issues are best suggested or reported via GitHub Issue:

<https://github.com/rdmorganiser/rdmo/issues/new/choose>

Of course, we also accept requests via all other communication channels.
